		<h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
		<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
		<p>OkenoChile had been staring out of his window for about an hour now. On his desk, there were
			 copies of <i>The Master Key System</i>, <i>The Alchemist</i>, <i>Think and Grow Rich </i>, 
			 <i>The Intelligent Investor</i>, <i>Self Reliance</i>, <i>The Art of War </i>, <i>Steve Jobs: A biography</i>, 
			 <i>Elon Musk Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future</i>, <i>Shoe Dog</i>, 
			 <i>Creativity Inc</i>, <i>Self Reliance by Ralph Waldo Emerson</i>, <i>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck</i>, and all the 
			 other books he had read, including a thumbed copy of <cite>A Brief History of Mankind</cite>. 
			 These had been only a few of OkenoChile's selected readings since college, and the longer he spent time behind 
			 the walls of his room reading, writing, and coding, and learning to produce music, the more he 
			 felt he needed to be free.</p>
		<p> He had spent the last ten years mostly closed inside his room, sitting on a computer doing writing,
			 academic research, programming, reading, and, recently, learning to produce music. This created a 
			 thought inside his head: <q> That, come rain come sunshine, he was an individual committed to making his own 
			decisions in life and that he was destined to do great things</q>. Although OkenoChile faced many 
			challenges from distracting petty behaviours of feeble-minded neighbours, continuous trolling and 
			harrassment by fools, belittling political propaganda directed towards him by political buffoons 
			and ethnic political puppets, he vowed to be an <abbr title="Architect">Arch</abbr> of his own life. That no 
			authority or individual will take away his freedom to decide on his personal life matters and that nobody will 
			decide, dictate nor influence his personal life choices in way that is contrary to his wishes. This, he 
			considered to be his own responsibility. Towards achieving his greater vision, OkenoChile chose <em>focus</em> 
			and <em>hardwork</em> while ignoring the sideshows of jealous nitwits who could be perfectly characterized as 
			idle-minded, illiterate, bootlicking, barking, snitching, and persecuting pettyfoggers.</p>

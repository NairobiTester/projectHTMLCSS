		<p><strong>Beware:</strong> Not everybody pretending to help you in life is a genuine helper. A 
			good example is when fawners pretend to be helpers in matters that don't need any help or 
			where help hasn't been sought by the individual they're pretending to be helping.</p>
		<p>This world is full of people of different characters. <strong>There are inspiring, thinking and 
			great individuals in the world who would offer valuable help or advice. However, the world also has
			 idle, jealous busybodies who lack the capacity to occupy their minds with positive productivity 
			 but jealousy and distracting behaviours as well as silly tyrants who delude themselves into 
			 thinking that they have the right to control every aspect of a people's personal lives.

/***
CSS3 introduces the opacity property which allows you to specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements.
The value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5 is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15% opacity).
The CSS3 rgba property allows you to specify a color, just like you would with an RGB value, but adds a 
fourth value to indicate opacity. This value is known as an alpha value and is a number between 0.0 and 1.0
(so a value of 0.5 is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15% opacity). The rgba value will only affect the
element on which it is applied (not child elements) **/

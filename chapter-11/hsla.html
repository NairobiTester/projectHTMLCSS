		<h2>The Composition of Seawater</h2>
		<p>Almost anything can be found in seawater. This includes dissolved materials from Earth's crust as 
			well as materials released from organisms. The most important components of seawater that 
			influence life forms are salinity, temperature, dissolved gases (mostly oxygen and carbon dioxide),
			 nutrients, and pH. These elements vary in their composition as well as in their influence on 
			 marine life.</p>

<!--- hsl, hsla - The hsl color property has been introduced in CSS3 as an alternative way to specify colors.
The value of the property starts with the letters hsl, followed by individual values inside parentheses for:
hue - This is expressed as an angle (between 0 and 360 degrees).
saturation - This is expressed as a percentage.
lightness - This is expressed as a percentage with 0% being white, 50% being normal, and 100% being black.
The hsla color property allows you to specify color properties using hue, saturation, and lightness as above, 
and adds a fourth value which represents transparency (just like the rgba property). The a stands for:
alpha - This is expressed as a number between 0 and 1.0.
For example, 0.5 represents 50% transparency, and 0.75 represents 75% transparency.

/**
@font-face allows you to use a font, even if it is not installed on the computer of the person
browsing, by allowing you to specify a path to a copy of the font, which will be downloaded if
it is not on the user's machine. Because this technique allows a version of the font to be
downloaded to the user's computer, it is important that the license for the font permits it to
be used in this way. You add the font to your style sheet using the @font-face rule, as shown on the right.

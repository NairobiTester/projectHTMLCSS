		<h3>Breed History</h3>
		<p>The Briard is an ancient breed of large herding dog that originated in France. The breed has a long 
			and storied history, dating back to at least the eighth century AD. The breed was used by the Celts 
			as a herding dog, and was later bred by the French as a versatile working dog. During the Middle Ages, the Briard 
			was used as a guard dog, a messenger dog, and a war dog, and was prized for its intelligence, 
			loyalty, and bravery. In the 19th century, the Briard's popularity began to decline, and the 
			breed nearly became extinct. However, a group of dedicated breeders worked to preserve the breed,
			 and in 1863, the first Briard was exhibited at a dog show in Paris. During World War I, the 
			 Briard served as a messenger and ambulance dog, and was also used to search for wounded soldiers 
			 on the battlefield. After the war, the breed's popularity grew, and it became a popular companion
			 dog in France and other parts of Europe. Today, the Briard is still primarily a herding dog, but 
			 it is also used as a search and rescue dog, a therapy dog, and a family companion. The breed is 
			 known for its intelligence, loyalty, and protective nature, and is recognized by the American 
			 Kennel Club as a member of the Herding Group. The Briard is a beloved breed with a rich history 
			 and a bright future..</p>

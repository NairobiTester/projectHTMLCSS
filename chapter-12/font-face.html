		<h2>Breed History</h2>
		<p>The Briard is an ancient breed of large herding dog that originated in France. The breed has a long
			 and storied history, with some evidence suggesting that it may date back to the eighth century AD.
			It is believed that the Briard was first used by the Celts as a herding dog, and that it was later 
			bred by the French as a versatile working dog. During the Middle Ages, the Briard was used as a 
			guard dog, a messenger dog, and a war dog, and was prized for its intelligence, loyalty, and 
			bravery. In the 19th century, the Briard's popularity began to decline, and the breed nearly 
			became extinct. However, a group of dedicated breeders worked to preserve the breed, and in 1863, 
			the first Briard was exhibited at a dog show in Paris. During World War I, the Briard served as a 
			messenger and ambulance dog, and was also used to search for wounded soldiers on the battlefield. 
			After the war, the breed's popularity grew, and it became a popular companion dog in France and 
			other parts of Europe. Today, the Briard is still primarily a herding dog, but it is also used as 
			a search and rescue dog, a therapy dog, and a family companion. The breed is known for its 
			intelligence, loyalty, and protective nature, and is recognized by the American Kennel Club as a
			 member of the Herding Group.</p>

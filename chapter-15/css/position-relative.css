/**
Relative Positioning: When an element is positioned relatively, it remains in the normal flow of the document 
but can be moved from its original position using the "top", "right", "bottom", and "left" properties. The 
element is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow. Relative positioning is often 
used for things like shifting an element slightly up or down from its original position.**/

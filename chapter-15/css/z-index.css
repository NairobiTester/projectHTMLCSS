    /**
    When you use relative, fixed, or absolute positioning, boxes can overlap. If boxes do overlap, the
elements that appear later in the HTML code sit on top of those that are earlier in the page. If you want to 
control which element sits on top, you can use the z-index property. Its value is a number, and the higher 
the number the closer that element is to the front. For example, an element with a z-index of 10
will appear over the top of one with a z-index of 5. This example  uses relative positioning for
the <p> elements. Because the paragraphs are relatively positioned, by default they would appear over the top 
of the heading as the user scrolls down the page. To ensure that the <h1> element stays on top, we
use the z-index property on the rule for the <h1> element. The z-index is sometimes referred to as the stacking
context (as if the blocks have been stacked on top of each other on a z axis). If you are familiar with 
desktop publishing packages, it is the equivalent of using the 'bring to front' and 'send to back' 
features. **/

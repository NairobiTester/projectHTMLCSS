		<h1>The Evolution of the Bicycle</h1>
		<p class="example">The bicycle has undergone many changes since its invention in the early 19th century. The earliest bicycles, known as "velocipedes" or "boneshakers," were made entirely of wood and featured a large front wheel and a smaller rear wheel. These designs were difficult to ride and dangerous, and it wasn't until the introduction of the "safety bicycle" in the 1880s that cycling became a popular form of transportation.</p>
		<p>The safety bicycle was characterized by its chain-driven rear wheel and equal-sized wheels, which made it much easier to ride. It also featured improvements such as pneumatic tires, which provided a smoother ride, and brakes, which made it safer to stop. In the early 20th century, bicycles became even more popular, and were used for everything from transportation to racing.</p>
		<p>In the decades that followed, bicycles continued to evolve. The introduction of lightweight materials like aluminum and carbon fiber made them faster and more efficient, while advances in gearing and suspension made them more versatile. Today, there are many different types of bicycles available, including road bikes, mountain bikes, and electric bikes, each designed for a specific purpose. Despite these changes, however, the basic design of the bicycle has remained largely unchanged, and it continues to be a popular mode of transportation and recreation around the world.</p>

    /***
A gradient in CSS is a way to create a transition between two or more colors, creating a smooth color blend. 
This can be done using the CSS property background-image, which allows you to specify a gradient as the 
background for an element. There are two types of gradients: linear and radial. A linear gradient transitions 
between colors in a straight line, while a radial gradient transitions in a circular pattern from the center 
point.
Here is an example of a linear gradient:

background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, #00bfff, #1e90ff);

This creates a gradient that transitions from #00bfff at the top to #1e90ff at the bottom.

And here is an example of a radial gradient:

background-image: radial-gradient(circle at center, #00bfff, #1e90ff);

This creates a gradient that transitions from #00bfff at the center to #1e90ff at the edges, in a circular 
pattern.

Gradients can also be customized further with various CSS properties such as background-size, background-position, 
and background-repeat. Overall, gradients are a powerful tool for adding visual interest to websites and 
web applications.
